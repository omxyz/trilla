# Dope Millionaire Visionaries (TRILLA) 

```
DMV: Dope Millionaire Visionaries is an episodic visual album about a venture capitalist that has an existential crisis and starts investing in underrepresented founders. It's a dark comedy that uses hip hop to move the story forward and the artist, SPIDR, collaborates creatively with real founders and VCs via their contributed beats, rap verses, and more. DMV is the first series of its kind and a prototype for a new episodic visual album content format called the "Trilla" which is housed on a new creator platform called BLCK UNICRN. BLCK UNICRN is the only destination for this specific episodic visual album/ Trilla content and its a centralized platform to help known and unknown music artists collaborate, monetize, and create deeper fan/ community connections via a musical metaverse comprised of immersive content and experiences built around music. 

The Problem and The Community:

The fastest growing tech platforms today only benefit the top 1% of  humanity. This is a problem. "Dope Millionaire Visionaries" is a community of founders, creatives, LPs, and venture capitalists that are committed to making a positive impact of the world for the good of all of humankind. 

DMV's VC protagonist (Roy/ SPIDR) used to work at the most successful venture firm of all time. The firm came to prominence via their "Seven Deadly Sins" thesis, and the team of 7, effectively bet on the most evil traits of humankind, earning unprecedented returns in the technology industry. Roy is visited by Jesus and his sidekick Yor one day and is condemned to hell unless he starts betting on the good of humankind. With that, Roy leaves his firm and starts his own fund: "Dope Millionaire Visionaries." 

The NFTs:

Before Roy disappeared he minted a limited amount of horcruxes that were scattered across the metaverse on the blockchain as NFTs. These NFTs are a key to the BLCK UNICRN mafia, and provide clues to his latest investment thesis, an opportunity to buy into the BLCK UNICRN fund comprised of the most valuable tech unicorns in the Web3 era, and other cool utility perks.

Roadmap For The DMV DAO:

Phase 1: Create a new age Web3 venture capitalist, founder, and creative community that invests in unicorns that benefit the 99%. Execute on a new thesis that is the antithesis of the "Seven Deadly Sins" thesis.

Phase 2: Create more technological innovation by diversifying the tech industry.

Phase 3: Develop 1000 BLCK UNICRNS!
